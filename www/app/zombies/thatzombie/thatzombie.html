            The zombies were created by a Manticore strike. In the intel from Bio Lab, Irons states that Manticore has a second effect to regenerate cells that are possibly dead, but this was unconfirmed.
            <br>
            <br> Zombies with-out exo suits, they move at different speeds and will attack the closest player. Watch out for Zombies with exo suits as they can do more things than normal ones. Sense they have an exo suit they do more damage then normal ones and can boost jump to a player to hurt them. Just like when you have an exo suit, you do more damage. They also move at different speeds.

                <h1>Hosts</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Hosts can be easily distinguished from other zombies by a much different appearance; their appearance is a "lumpy" zombie that emits green Manticore clouds from the mouth. They appear to have a needle injected into their infected right hand signifying the zombie was tested on by Atlas scientists.
            <br>
            <br> Hosts appear during special rounds along with other zombies. When hitting a player, that player becomes "infected", and must use the Decontamination Zone within 60 seconds or they will die. The player(s) screen will start to darken when the infected timer has reached 5 seconds and will slowly turn into a zombie. While infected, any hit from a Host will deduct five seconds from the timer. Once the player is cured by the Zone, they can be re-infected as many times as possible.
            <br>
            <br> Once the last zombie of the Hosts round is killed, it will drop a Full Reload power-up, and any infected player will be cured without needing to go to the Decontamination Zone. When the player kills a Host, it will explode and leak out green fluid.
            <br>
            <br> When it is a Host round, Angie will give the player(s) a warning over the intercom. "Attention, Security has been breached" signifying the Hosts are coming.

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            As suggested by their name, as well as being mentioned by Kahn, they are dogs that were used by the security and were zombified.
            <br>
            <br> Security Dogs, like Hellhounds, appear during special rounds (the announcer will say it in the beginning of the round). The dogs will come out of their kennels[2] and attack the players. When the last one is killed, it will drop a Full Reload power-up.
            <br>
            <br> Dogs can spawn either as regular ones, or as special ones that behave like EMZs and whose attacks will disable the player's exo. There is also a type of dog that behaves like Exploders.
            <br>
            <br> While rather weak opponents, they deal the same damage per attack as regular zombies and are faster, which can make them dangerous, especially the EMZ-like ones.

            <div class="description">
                Chargers appear randomly during rounds. They can be easily noticed by the red mist coming out their eyes, mouth and body.
                <br>
                <br> Chargers are faster than normal zombies. They run faster and tend more regularly to use their exosuit to jump towards the player and attack them. Should the player's health be at a low level, chargers can be dangerous, as they can easily reach a player and hit them.

            </div>
            <div class="description">
                EMZs have exosuits, and can be easily distinguished from other zombies by electricity on their body. They seem to spawn after round 4.
                <br>
                <br> When a player is hit by the EMZ or if a player attempts to boost away from one, it will produce an EMP, shutting down the player's exo. The exosuit is disabled for five seconds, and during these five seconds, the player will not be able to use any exosuit ability. Their view will also be blurred, similarly to the System Hack effects. When an EMZ dies the dead corpse will leak out a blue fluid of some sort, possibly the electricity it has been exposed to. It is best to kill an EMZ once spotted, as disabling exosuits can be problematic in higher rounds, as it prevents the player from using it to quickly escape.

            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Exploders can be distinguished from regular zombies by green liquid around their body and on fire. They spawn during regular rounds, and can spawn as soon as round 1.
                <br>
                <br>
                When approached, the Exploder will, as its name indicates, explode. The explosion deals small damage to nearby players but will one-hit kill nearby zombies. If the player does not kill an Exploder for a period of time, it will charge up and when killed the blast radius will increase and possibly hurt or in rare cases down any player in the vicinity
